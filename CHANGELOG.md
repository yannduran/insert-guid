# Roadmap

- [ ] Add a way to select various formats for the guid
- [ ] Detect if the selected text is a valid guid, then change text to "Regenerate Guid"
- [ ] Detect multi-selection and change command text to "Insert Guid**s**" or "Regenerate Guids"
 if selection has valid guids

Features that have a checkmark are complete and available for
download in the
[CI build](http://vsixgallery.com/extension/YD.InsertGuid/).
